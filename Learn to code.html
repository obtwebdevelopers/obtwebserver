				<h2> What Is Coding? </h2>
					<img id="img2" src="http://www.obtwebserver.com/Images/learntocode1.jpg" />
<p> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a worldwide markup language that allows a user to create his or her own web page. While HTML is a fairly easy to learn markup language, it does involve several hundred commands to learn and memorize. With HTML the user creates tags. Tags are represented by greater than and less than signs opening and closing the text that make up code. The tags identify where the commands begin and end. For example, < b > Bold Text < /b > tells the browser that < b > is the beginning of the bold text statement that will turn anything after that tag bold. Once the browser hits < /b > the browser then turns the bold text statement off, allowing for only specific text to be bold. There are many websites one could visit to learn how to code with HTML and other languages.</p></center>
					<h2> HTML </h2>
						<p> The most basic programming language to create a basic website. This is where texts, links, and images are placed into. HTML gives your webpage structure and tells the web browser how to display your webpage.</p>
				<h2> Css </h2>
<p> CSS or Cascading Style Sheet is used to format the look of your HTML website and make it  look attractive. CSS is important because it affects the feel and mood of the website interface.</p>
				<h2> JavaScript</h2>
			            <p> Java script is one of the worldâ€™s most popular programming language. It is most commonly used on a webpage. JavaScript allows your webpage to be interactive. It allows animated objects to appear on the current webpage without having the user switching to another page. Java enhances users experience and improved function dynamics.</p>

				<h2> Importance of Code </h2>
					<img id="img2" src="http://www.obtwebserver.com/Images/Learntocode2.jpg" />
						<p> Coding, why is it important to learn code you might ask? Coding is important because it creates the building blocks of the future. Technology keeps evolving and the number of coding jobs in America are expected to increase 30% by the year 2020. Understanding programming concepts or even knowing a bit of code will be important to almost any job in the future. Knowledge is power when it comes to web design and development. Take the necessary time to do some research and find out what is best for you. </p>

<b>Problem-solving</b>
<p>Writing, debugging, and remixing your own and other people's code are fundamentally problem-solving activities. Whether it's code that won't run because of syntax errors, something working differently than you expected, or figuring out how to do something cool, these are all things that involve lateral thinking. And often this problem-solving involves working with other people - either in real-time or following tutorials, blog posts and how-to guides (and then sharing back).</p>

<b>Digital confidence</b>
<p>Digital literacy often leads to an increased sense of confidence. Not only confidence in terms of social interaction but also a sense of agency in shaping the environments in which people find themselves. In digital (or blended) environments, this means people not only being able to decode what they see, but encode it too: reading, writing and thinking computationally instead of merely consuming what others have produced.</p>

<b>Understanding the world</b>
<p>can use is, he says, "Perhaps the most important thing." In a world where almost everything has either a digital component or is somehow digitally mediated, being able to both read and write our environment is more important than ever.</p>

				<h2> Benefits of Coding </h2>
					<img id="img2" src="http://www.obtwebserver.com/Images/learntocode3.jpg" />
						<p> Learning to code empowers you to do many things you would not otherwise be able to do. These things include hand-crafting your own websites, becoming a career coder or even starting a technology business. Most importantly, you will be able to understand the technology shaping your world. You have undoubtedly heard or read somewhere that everyone needs to learn coding, right? Well, people say that for a reason! Whether you are looking for a career in the industry, starting a new hobby or just wanting to understand technology, you can benefit from learning to code. <p>
							<b>Make Your Own Website</b>
								<p>It's incredible to think how much the world has changed since 1991, when the World Wide Web first started. The web has taken over our lives and it's showing no sign of stopping. Who knows where the web will take us in the future? Perhaps in another 10 years every person will have their own website. If one thing's certain, it's that a website is a very valuable thing to have these days. If you own a business, a web presence is a must. If you don't, you still might want a personal blog or portfolio site to sell your skills to prospective employers. Of course, your ability to create and maintain a website is severely limited unless you learn HTML and CSS code, the code that all websites run on.</p>
							<b>Start a Business</b>
								<p>Let's say you've got an idea for a software product or web business. You want to create the next Facebook. But you're short on cash, and being able to hire a team of coders is a pie in the sky. Why not learn code and build the product yourself? It's a path that many entrepreneurs are choosing to go down. They've started off with virtually no coding knowledge and have gone on to build their own small software businesses. For example, Nick D'Aloisio famously sold his iPhone app, Summly, to Yahoo! for $30m. Some of the kinds of businesses you can start include...<p>
									<ul>
										<li>selling software</li>
										<li>selling mobile apps</li>
										<li>e-commerce</li>
										<li>selling your coding time.</li>
									</ul>
								<p>If you do have a product idea, there's no reason to sit twiddling your thumbs waiting for money to fall out of the sky. If you can learn code, you'll not only be able to realize your product, but also know the source code of your software inside and out.</p>
