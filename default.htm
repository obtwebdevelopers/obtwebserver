					<a href='http://www.obtjobs.org/'><img id="img1" src="http://www.obtwebserver.com/Images/home2.png" /></a>
					
						<p> The mission of <b>Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow</b> is to help disadvantaged youth and adults recognize their own self-worth, and advance towards self-sufficiency and financial security through job training, academic reinforcement, improved life skills, job placement, and support services. OBT approaches all of its programmatic endeavors with the three principles in mind:</p>
						<p><b>Confidence:</b> All of OBT's programs seek to in still confidence in participants so that they can increase their self-esteem and improve their own chances to succeed.</p>
						<p><b>Discipline:</b> OBT's training model stresses personal discipline. OBT's high standards and expectations hold participants accountable for their own success, making no excuses if they fail. </p>
						<p><b>Professionalism:</b> All of OBT's programs are modeled after a "simulated" corporate work environment. Participants are required to dress and groom professionally, be on time each day, handle work assignments with deadlines, and behave as they would be expected to behave at work. Sometimes OBT's philosophy is referred to as "tough love." While our high standards and emphasis on professionalism represent the "tough" side of the equation, the "love" is demonstrated each day through a supportive staff that devotes their time and energy, in a caring and empathetic way, to helping people succeed.</p>

					<a href='http://obtwebserver.com/Learn%20to%20code.html'><img id="img2" src="http://www.obtwebserver.com/Images/home4.png" /></a>
					  <p> Source code is written in one or more programming languages, (such as C, Fortran, JavaScript, Lisp, Python, Ruby, Smalltalk, etc.). The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic. Related tasks include testing, debugging, maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system, and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. </p>
						<p> Why do you want to learn to code? Are you going to spend your time learning this new skill for the right reason? If it's for pure personal enjoyment, great, go for it, but if you signed up to learn how to code because you "think" it might solve some problem you are having, you should probably put more thought on that a bit more.</p>
<p> Maybe you like to work with your hands and want to learn how to build an application for smart phones. Perhaps you just want to figure out how to add content to your website without asking for help - starting with HTML and CSS would suit you fine. If you are a product manager and tired of developers putting one over on you, a coding class to understand the fundamentals could be a great choice.</p>

				<h2> Jobs in Web Development and Design</h2>
					<a href=''><img id="img3" src="http://www.obtwebserver.com/Images/home3.png" /></a>
					<p> Web developers are a particular category of computer programmers that focus on the development and maintenance of applications and services deployed via the Internet. Web developers are most often associated with webpages. However the responsibilities of web developers within technology domains are much more diverse than that and often involve distributed network applications. Web development is a very popular field for programmers because there are many web development entry-level positions available and those positions often provide diverse practical experience and many career opportunities.</p>
					<p> There are approximately 113,000 web developers in the workforce. That continues a trend of job growth, and salary increase, within the field. These numbers do not reflect self-employed web developers, which represents a significant population as well. The vast majority of web developer positions are found in the computer systems design and information services domains. Nevertheless, there is also expanding availability in other domains such as consulting, advertising and public relations. Educated, skilled web developers can also fill numerous analyst and programmer jobs.</p>
